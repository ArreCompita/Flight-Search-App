# FlightSearchAppPractice
Flight Search App developed as an Android jetpack compose practice.

--When the user first opens the app, they see an empty screen with a text field, prompting for an airport.

--When the user starts typing, the app displays a list of autocomplete suggestions that match either the airport name or identifier.

--When the user selects a suggestion, the app displays a list of all possible flights from that airport. Each item includes the identifier and names for both airports, and a button to save the destination as a favorite.

--When the user clears the search box or does not enter a search query, the app displays a list of saved favorite destinations, if any exist.
